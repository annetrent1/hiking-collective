  This is the place for those who have been hiking for years, their whole lives,
  or are just beginning. Here, you can connect with other hikers easily wherever
  you are. We understand that those who love hiking are free spirits, and we
  want people to maintain that freedom. You can find others who love to explore
  nature, escape to beautiful landscapes, and discover new places with people
  who will appreciate it as much as you do.

  Across all of the world are some of the most wondrous things. The most
  unexpected places hold some of the most beautiful sights in the world.
  Catching the perfect sunrise in the morning while on a mountaintop, or hearing
  the ocean as you drift to sleep next to a campfire.
